HTML STRUCTURE

PAGE BEHAVIOUR

NAVIGATION
Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.

SECTION ACTIVE STATE
It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.

SCROLL TO ANCHOR
When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.


SUGGESTED ITEMS TO IMPROVE PROJECT
- Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
- Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load).
- Hint: setTimeout can be used to check when the user is no longer scrolling.
- Add a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
- Update/change the design/content.
- Make sections collapsible.
